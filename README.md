# Project Title: Creating Robust Neural Network Generalisation for a Single-Camera Self-Driving Car
Archive for files, code and other details related my 2020 Final Year Project (EERI 474) for the purpose of ECSA Moderation. 

This project was based on version 3 of the Donkey Car (https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/). The Donkey Car is an open-source
self-driving library written in Python and using tools like Keras, Tensorflow, and OpenCV. This system can be installed on a 
Raspberry Pi/Jetson Nano hooked up to an RC car, or it can be run in the Donkey Car Unity Simulator (https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar).

The Donkey Car (https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar/blob/dev/LICENSE), as well as this EERI 474 Project, is licensed under the  [MIT Open Source
License](LICENSE).
